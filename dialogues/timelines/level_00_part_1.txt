P.A.M.: Hi there! I am Plan-It's very own Planetary Administration Module, but you can call me P․A․M․
P.A.M.: Fun fact! You are exactly twelve minutes late to your first shift!
- Thanks! :D
	P.A.M.: You are very welcome!
- Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.
	P.A.M.: There is no traffic here! Or cars. I can make you a car if you want to sit in it and not move.
- Where am I?
	P.A.M.: You are right there! And also everywhere, but mostly right there in that specific chair.
P.A.M.: Anyway, let us get to work! Here is a diagram of your desk.[generate_grid()]
P.A.M.: It is perfectly optimized for eternal productivity!
- Fun!
	P.A.M.: Exactly! Productivity is objectively the best emotion.
- I... guess?
	P.A.M.: Your vitals indicate mild dissatisfaction. Would you like a decoration? I can provide a freshly cut petunia.
	- That would be great!
		P.A.M.: Here you go.[show_petunia(true)]
		P.A.M.: Please do not eat it.
	- Maybe later.
		P.A.M.: Okay! I will dissolve the petunia back into the cosmic void.
- Eternal? Am i a... god?
	P.A.M.: Not exactly! You are an eternal being of immense cosmic power. "God" is a human concept with a lot of messy baggage.
	P.A.M.: Fun fact! Baggage here is completely literal and very heavy.
P.A.M.: Here is your Godputer![place_item("godputer", 2, 2)]
P.A.M.: That is where the magic happens. Literally!
P.A.M.: Right now, the magic is physically blocking your spatial orientation.
P.A.M.: Please move it farther away from you into any of the cells in the top row so you do not get atomized!
